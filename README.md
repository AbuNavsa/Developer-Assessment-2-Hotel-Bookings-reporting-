# Developer Assessment 2 - Hotel Bookings Reporting
Software requirements:

- Python 3 - Python 3.7 recommended. Python 8+ has not updated the relevant modules so will cause errors.
- Windows OS


SETUP:

1) If you are running Python 3.8 or above, please install Python 3.7 or below. We recommened Python 3.7 which can be downloaded from the offical website here: https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.0/python-3.7.0.exe

2) If you are downloading Python 3.7.0 from the provided link, make sure that "Add Python 3.7 to PATH" has been checked â˜‘ . This option is on the initial installer screen when executed.

3) Within the downloaded project file, access the 'setup' folder and for WINDOWS run the 'setup.cmd' file, if attempting to run on MAC OS run the 'setup.sh' file.

4) Once the file has run successfully, you can run the 'Hotel Bookings.exe' executable which can be found in Program files/dist folder.

5) If you would like to assess the source code and documentation, please access the file 'hotel_bookings.py' in the Program files folder. Thereafter, right click and select edit with the text editor or IDE of your choice.

6) The instructions for the program are below.


MANUAL:

1) The project is to explore hotel booking data and provide reports on upcoming bookings.

2) Once executed, you will be prompted to open a file for the program to analyse. Open the 'hotel_bookings.csv'.

3) The command line will ask for the date for which you would like to see the hotel details for. N.B: If the date is not entered in the correct format of [YYYY-MM-DD], the program will request the date again.

4) Once the date has been entered, all of the hotel information for the requested day until 6 days after (7 days total) will be displayed in a table. The data for cancelled bookings will not be displayed.

5) The program will ask if you would like to save this information to a new .csv file. Type "Y, ""Yes", "y" or "yes" to save the file. A save dialog will open where you can choose the location to save the file. Type "N" or anything else to carry on with the analysis.

6) A table will be presented displaying the total numbers of adults, children and babies. Following step 4) you can choose to save this data or continue with the program.

7) You will then be asked to press ENTER to search another date for analysis.
